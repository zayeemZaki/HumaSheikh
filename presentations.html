          In October 2024, Huma Sheikh presented her paper titled “My Father and
          His Khan Dress” at the 53rd Annual Conference on South Asia, hosted by
          the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The paper explores personal and
          political memory through the lens of family, particularly her father’s murder,
          and examines themes of gender and cultural identity in the context of
          conflict in Kashmir. Engaging with ideas of loss, inheritance, and
          resistance, the presentation contributed to a broader conversation on
          diasporic narratives and postcolonial belonging.
