              The paper explores personal and political memory through the lens of family, particularly 
              her father’s murder, and examines themes of gender and cultural identity in the context 
              of conflict in Kashmir. Engaging with ideas of loss, inheritance, and resistance, the 
              presentation contributed to a broader conversation on diasporic narratives and postcolonial belonging.
